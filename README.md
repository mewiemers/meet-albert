This is my capstone project for the Neue Fische Web Development bootcamp I attended in spring of 2021.
Meet Albert is a web app to learn the first English skills.
In an educational game you visit different marked cities on the map with "Albert", the platypus.
There you meet typical Australian animals that introduce themselves. Afterwards there is a quiz to test your new knowledge.
It works best in a web browser.
